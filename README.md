# JACQ: Cognitive Operating System

> *A unified workspace where AI remembers, learns, and self-corrects.*

---

## The Problem

AI tools today are brilliant but forgetful. Start a conversation, build context, and then... it's gone. Every new session starts from zero. This "context amnesia" makes AI unreliable for complex, multi-step work.

## The Solution

JACQ gives AI persistent memory and the ability to learn from past interactions.

It is a workspace where I can research, write, code, and create visuals—all in one place. The system remembers past work, learns my preferences, and proactively suggests next steps.

## Core Capabilities

- **Persistent Memory:** Conversations and decisions are stored locally. Context builds over time.
- **Proactive Suggestions:** The system analyzes patterns and recommends next actions.
- **Self-Correction:** Outputs are verified before shipping. Errors are caught, not propagated.
- **Multi-Modal:** Text, code, and visuals flow into one another in a single canvas.
